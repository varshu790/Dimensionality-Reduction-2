        "\n",
        "PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique used to simplify complex datasets by identifying patterns and reducing the number of variables while retaining the most critical information. It achieves this by finding a set of new variables, known as principal components, which are linear combinations of the original variables. These components are ordered by the amount of variance they capture, with the first component capturing the most variance, the second component capturing the second most, and so on.\n",

Mathematically, this is done by computing the dot product between the original data matrix and the matrix of principal components.

        "ANS- The choice of the number of principal components in PCA significantly impacts its performance and the resulting representation of the data. Here's how different choices can affect PCA:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Dimensionality Reduction:**\n",
        "   - Choosing a smaller number of principal components leads to greater dimensionality reduction. It means representing the data in a lower-dimensional space.\n",
        "   - This reduction can simplify data visualization, computation, and storage requirements while retaining essential information.\n",
        "\n",

        "   - The number of principal components chosen determines how much variance in the original data is preserved in the reduced-dimensional space.\n",
        "   - More principal components retain more variance, meaning they capture more information from the original dataset.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Focus on High Variance Dimensions:**\n",
        "   - PCA identifies the principal components based on the directions of maximum variance in the dataset.\n",
